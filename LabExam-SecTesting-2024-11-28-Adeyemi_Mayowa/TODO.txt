LabExam 2024-11-28: Key Derivation + Symmetric Encryption
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a class called "MessageEncrypter" with the following operations:

A) __init__(self, password, salt, iv) [4 points]
   A constructor that takes a "password", a "salt" and a "iv" and uses a key 
   derivation function to generate a secret key (use the standard settings 
   from the repository).  
   The secret key and the given initialization vector "iv" are used to setup
   an AES cipher in CTR mode.

B) encrypt_message(self, message) [3 points]
   Encrypt the given message with the AES cipher and returns a hex-string
   of the ciphertext.

C) decrypt_message(self, data) [3 points]
   Decrypt the given data (ciphertext as hex-string) and return the plaintext 
   message. 

Verify your implementations with the given "MessageEncryptorTest" class.


The small print
---------------
1. Project name: Rename the project (and the submitted ZIP file) so 
that instead of "MyName" your name is used. 
Please note that projects that do not comply with the naming 
convention will be deducted 50% of the points!

2. Manual review: A manual code review is performed for each solution 
when grading. 

3. Syntax errors: Implementation artifacts that contain syntax errors 
won't count.

4. Solutions that are obviously copied or copied will be assessed 
negatively (with 0 points).
