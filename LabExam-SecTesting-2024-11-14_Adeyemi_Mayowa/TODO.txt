LabExam 2024-11-14: Base64 + Message Digest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a class called "HashToken" with the following operation: 
[2+2+2+4 points]

A) hash(self, header_str:str, payload_str:str)->str:
   - Encode header_str base64 
   - Encode payload_str base64
   - Concatenate the base64 encoded header with a "." and the base64 encoded 
      payload 
   - Calculate a SHA256 hash value from this resulting string.

Example: 
   header: '{"alg":"HS256"}'
   payload: '{"sub":"teini"}

Verify your implementations with the given "HashTokenTest" class.


The small print
---------------
1. Project name: Rename the project (and the submitted ZIP file) so 
that instead of "MyName" your name is used. 
Please note that projects that do not comply with the naming 
convention will be deducted 50% of the points!

2. Manual review: A manual code review is performed for each solution 
when grading. 

3. Syntax errors: Implementation artifacts that contain syntax errors 
won't count.

4. Solutions that are obviously copied or copied will be assessed 
negatively (with 0 points).
